# StudentTestingApplication

Hello.

This application was meant for my college classes group project designing.
We had to implement application that allows professors to test their students.

That was my first project I have fully accomplished to it's working state, with pretty much no experience in Java Spring.
My team chose to switch to it 2 months before deadline,
so as a main-and-only dev in my team I made this application in about 3 - 4 weeks.

Please keep it in mind while you are looking at the code.

Project was done with 06/14/2019.


Working application is accessible on my google drive: https://bit.ly/2uWX28H.
